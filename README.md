# FALBA

Falba is a tool for managing and analyzing test results.

## Data Model

The core concepts in Falba are designed to organize test outputs into a structured database.

### Result
A **Result** represents a single execution of a test. It is the fundamental unit of storage in the database.

**Result Identity**: A Result is uniquely identified by two components:
1.  **Test Name**: A user-provided string that groups related results (e.g., "web-server-benchmark").
2.  **Result ID**: A hash derived from the content of all artifacts associated with the result. This means that a result is defined by its data; if two runs produce identical artifacts, they share the same ID.

### Artifact
An **Artifact** is a raw file produced by a test execution. Artifacts are stored within the Result and serve as the source of truth. They can be log files, JSON dumps, CSVs, or any other file format generated by the test.

### Fact
A **Fact** is a piece of information *about* a Result. Facts typically represent the inputs or environmental conditions of the test (e.g., "git_commit", "instance_type", "concurrency_level").
-   Facts are extracted from Artifacts.
-   Each Result has a set of unique Facts.
-   Facts are typed values (int, float, string, bool).

### Metric
A **Metric** is an output measured during the test. Metrics represent the performance or behavior of the system under test (e.g., "requests_per_second", "latency_p99").
-   Metrics are extracted from Artifacts.
-   A Result can have multiple Metrics.
-   Metrics have a name, a typed value, and an optional unit (e.g., "ns", "B").

### Parsers
**Parsers** are the bridge between raw **Artifacts** and structured **Facts** and **Metrics**.
-   Parsers are defined in a configuration file (`parsers.json`).
-   They define logic to extract specific values from Artifacts based on patterns (e.g., regular expressions, JSON paths).
-   When a Result is read, the configured Parsers run over its Artifacts to populate its Facts and Metrics.
